Hello. I Am [Dann](https://dannberg.me) and this is my blog. I am an entrepreneur living in New York City. I write, create, compute, and collect and have my hands in a number of different projects. I'm passionate about technology, start-ups, business, social media and the Internet. I'll tell you all about it.

I created this blog as a way to join the conversation involving big ideas and concepts that interest me. It's a way to brainstorm out loud, share ideas, concepts, or work flows that have have been helpful to me. I seek to be a voice of reason when everyone is freaking out, and to be freaking out while everyone else is placidly standing idle. I wish to never stop thinking.

If you have any feedback or want to get in contact with me, feel free to shoot me an [email](#) or just use my [contact page](/contact). I'm always looking to meet new people and get involved in different projects.

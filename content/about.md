**Hello.** I am {{< dann >}} and this is my website. It hosts all my writing on technology, finance, productivity, entrepreneurship, writing, and more. It also serves as a centralized hub to link together my creative output.

I am the *Director of Community* at **[Vantage](https://www.vantage.sh/)**, a nifty tool that helps users understand cloud costs and automate savings. Previously, I've served in senior FinOps roles at several tech startups, including _Senior Technical Program Manager for Cloud Costs_ at **[FullStory](https://www.fullstory.com/)** and _Senior FinOps Analyst_ / _Team Lead_ at **[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com)**.

FinOps, for those unfamiliar, is a burgeoning new engineering discipline helping organizations get maximum business value by leveraging the variable spend model of the cloud (learn more at **[FinOps.org](https://www.finops.org/)**). I'm also active in the wider FinOps community, previously serving as a **[FinOps Foundation Ambassador](https://www.finops.org/about/ambassadors/#ambassadors)**, and continuing to run (now as co-host) the monthly **[NYC FinOps Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/New-York-City-Cloud-FinOps/)**.

In my free time, I'm an **[slow-but-steady reader](https://www.goodreads.com/dannb)** and an **[avid watcher of movies](https://letterboxd.com/dannb/)**. I also enjoy video games (_Binding of Isaac_, _Stardew Valley_, _Forager_) and board games (_Terraforming Mars_, _Codenames_, _Coup_).

I also have a _free_ monthly newsletter where I share five interesting things I learned or discovered in the past month. You should **[sign up](https://dannb.org/newsletter)**.

## What is this site?

I keep creating new personal websites, but can never seem to take down the old ones. My first ever blog was **[IAmDann.com](http://iamdann.com)**, and self-publishing there helped me secure my first tech journalism job. A few of those articles are re-published here, but the website and content is old and I'm mostly keeping it online as a time capsule for myself. Additionally, I created and maintained **[Novice No Longer](http://novicenolonger.com)** several years back when I was freelancing full-time. Some of those articles have been re-published here as well.

I created this specific blog as a way to process my own ideas. Explaining thoughts and concepts to someone else helps me learn and think. You'll find articles and tutorials on a wide range of topics (whatever I'm thinking about at the time), and I hope you'll be able to find something useful to you.

It was also a good excuse to teach myself **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**, the static site generator that powers this website. Take a peek at the **[source code](https://github.com/dannberg/dannb-org)** on Github. Feel free to remix/steal anything you like.

Some of the links (such as those to **[Amazon](https://amzn.to/2WfxUFf)**) are affiliate links. This means that if you click one of these links and then purchase something from Amazon within the next hour — even if it's not the item I linked to — a small portion of your sale will go to me. That's the best way to show your appriciation if you like any of the content here.

In terms of the **[Shop](https://dannberg.storenvy.com/)**, I've been printing stickers of my face since 2007. I just sort of think it's funny. I also think it's funny that there's now a store that sells stickers of my face. That's the sum total of it.

If you have any feedback or want to get in contact with me, feel free to shoot me an email at **dann [at] dannb [dot] org**. Or just shoot me an DM on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannberg/)**.

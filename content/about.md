**Hello.** I Am [Dann](https://dannberg.me) and this is my website. It hosts all my writing on technology, finance, productivity, entrepreneurship, writing, and more. It also serves as a centralized hub to link together my creative output.

I am a CloudOps Analyst working at **[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)** in New York City (see disclosure below). I'm part of a team focusing completely on Cloud Cost Optimization (an area of focus that is starting to be called **[FinOps](https://www.finops.org/)**). We bring visibility, understanding, and cost-optimization to cloud bills.

## What is this site?

I seem to keep creating new personal websites, but can never seem to take down the old ones. My first ever blog was **[IAmDann.com](http://iamdann.com)**, and self-publishing there helped me secure my first tech journalism job. I've re-published a few of those articles here, but am largely keeping that site alive as a time capsule for myself. Likewise, I created and maintained **[Novice No Longer](http://novicenolonger.com)** while I was freelancing full-time, but don't keep it updated anymore. Some of those articles have been re-published here as well.

I created this blog as a way to process my own thoughts. Nothing helps you understand a concept better than trying to explain it to someone else. You'll find articles and tutorials on a wide range of topics, and I'm hoping you'll be able to narrow things down and find something that's useful to you.

Some of the links (such as those to **[Amazon](https://amzn.to/2WfxUFf)**) are affiliate links. This means that if you click one of these links and then purchase something from Amazon within the next hour — even if it's not the item I linked to — a small portion of your sale will go to me. That's the best way to show your appriciation if you like any of the content here.

If you have any feedback or want to get in contact with me, feel free to shoot me an email at **dann [at] dann-berg [dot] com**. Or just shoot me an DM on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/dannberg)**.

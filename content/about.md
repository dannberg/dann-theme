Hello. I Am [Dann](https://dannberg.me) and this is my website. It hosts all my writing on technology, finance, productivity, entrepreneurship, writing, and more. It also serves as a centralized hub to link together my creative output.

I am a CloudOps Analyst working at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) in New York City (see disclosure below). I'm part of a team focusing completely on Cloud Cost Optimization (an area of focus that is starting to be called [FinOps](https://www.finops.org/)). We bring visibility, understanding, and cost-optimization to cloud bills.

TKTK I write, create, compute, and collect and have my hands in a number of different projects. I'm passionate about technology, start-ups, business, social media and the Internet. I'll tell you all about it.

I created this blog as a way to join the conversation involving big ideas and concepts that interest me. It's a way to brainstorm out loud, share ideas, concepts, or work flows that have have been helpful to me. I seek to be a voice of reason when everyone is freaking out, and to be freaking out while everyone else is placidly standing idle. I wish to never stop thinking.

If you have any feedback or want to get in contact with me, feel free to shoot me an [email](#) or just use my [contact page](/contact). I'm always looking to meet new people and get involved in different projects.

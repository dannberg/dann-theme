Jennifer Faull writing for _[The Drum](http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/08/09/how-accenture-trying-bring-programmatic-product-placement-netflix)_ (emphasis mine):

> Accenture’s R&D division has spent the last year developing breakthrough product placement technology that can seamlessly insert a brand into online video, including the ability to replace existing labelling.

And also:

> “**[We wanted] to [be able to] monetise (sic) huge back catalogues of existing video content** as well as offer content creators a way to place advertising in a non-disruptive way, open it to the marketplace and give them the benefit of a programmatic platform,” said Naressi.

The world of _30 Rock —_ where Jerry Seinfeld is [being digitally inserted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SeinfeldVision) into NBC's new programming lineup without his knowledge or consent — is becoming real.

I foresee advertising getting really...subtle. Like, when I see a Microsoft Surface in a TV series now, I know it's a paid product placement. But soon everything will be a product placement, and it'll change depending on whether you just searched Google for new socks or for pimple cream.

NBC's _[Superstore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstore_(TV_series))_ is going to _thrive_.

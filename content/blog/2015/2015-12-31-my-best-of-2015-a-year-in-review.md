**This post originally appeared on [Novice No Longer](https://novicenolonger.com/my-best-of-2015-a-year-in-review/).**

Sitting here on New Year’s Eve day, I can’t help but feel reflective (as you can see from the gif). I like to take this time to go over my previous year-end posts ([2012](http://novicenolonger.com/my-best-of-2012/), [2013](http://novicenolonger.com/my-best-of-2013/)) and craft a new mega-post for this year. These types of posts are mostly for my own use, but I always like to post them publicly just in case any of this information can help you in any way. _Oh, the book links are affiliate links. Just a heads up._

This has been a big and eventful year, so let’s just dive right in.

## Most viewed blog posts by me

*   [Body Hacking: My Magnetic Implant](http://www.iamdann.com/2012/03/21/my-magnet-implant-body-modification) – _as always_
*   [5 Books that Shaped My Life](http://www.iamdann.com/2012/05/08/5-books-that-shaped-my-life) – _a really old article, and surprise second place_
*   [How I made my iPhone app: from idea to app store](http://novicenolonger.com/how-i-made-my-ios-app-reader-tracker/)
*   [My menubar: 16 apps that made the cut](http://novicenolonger.com/my-menu-bar-16-apps-that-made-the-cut/)

## Top video by me

**[Installing a purchased WordPress Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ0uTu4Vxkk)**

_This video became really popular this year, and currently has 11,061 views and 49 comments. It makes me want to create more video content._

## Total number of blog posts written

**Ten**

_Significantly lower than years past, but I’ve been working a full-time job unrelated to journalism or online business, so I’m not surprised. I definitely want this number to be higher in 2016._

## Top fiction books read

*   _**[Infinite Jest](http://amzn.to/1P2HPA0)**_ by David Foster Wallace
    _I’m actually reading this for a second time. Felt inspired after seeing the movie [The End of the Tour](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3416744/). I love this book._
*   _**[Wild](http://amzn.to/1JLXXV4)**_ by Cheryl Strayed
    _I knew I’d like this book, but didn’t realize just **how much** I’d like it. **Highly** recommended._
*   _**[The Martian](http://amzn.to/1JLY4zW)**_ by Andy Weir
    _The characters were_ terrible_, the writing mediocre, but dammit if it wasn’t a fun and entertaining read. So much better than the movie._

## Top non-fiction books read

*   _**[The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up](http://amzn.to/1P2I6mv)**_ by Marie Kondo
    _I’m putting this on the list, even though I still have a little left to go. There will be a mass tidying in 2016._

## Favorite recently-released movies (no particular order)

*   **[It Follows](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3235888/)**
    _I’m typically not the biggest fan of horror/suspense, but this movie is **incredibly** well done. Bravo._
*   **[The End of the Tour](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3416744/)**
    _I miss David Foster Wallace. :(_
*   **[The Dance of Reality](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2301592/)**
    _I was excited when I heard that Alejandro Jodorowsky was making a new film. Then I saw it, and was blown away._
*   **[This is Where I Leave You](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371150/)**
    _Shut up, I liked it. Jason Bateman and Tina Fey are so great._
*   **[Wild](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2305051/)**
    _Book was way better, obviously, but this was still a great movie._
*   **[Unfriended](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3713166/)**
    _Another movie I’m surprised made the list. The gimmick doesn’t feel gimmicky — in fact it makes it more fun to watch._

## Favorite TV Shows

Nathan for you, Game of Thrones, The Soup (_I’ll miss you_), Last Week Tonight, The Last Man on Earth

## Gadgets of choice

*   **2014 13-inch MacBook Pro**
    _This is my work computer, but it makes the top of my list anyhow. I love this machine._
*   **iPad Pro**
    _I got this mid-December, but it’s already one my favorite belongings. It’s replaced my personal 2011 13-inch MacBook Air for so many things (but not everything yet)._
*   **Kindle**
    _I use the old model. No touch screen. That way I can move my finger along as I read. It’s better that way._
*   **UE Boom 2**
    _This bluetooth speaker is goddamn amazing. Even though it only plays podcasts 99 percent of the time._

## Biggest accomplishments

**Have an original one act I wrote produced on 42nd Street**

_In March, a play I wrote called [Diary: A One Act Play](http://casadebeverley.com/diary-a-one-act-play/) was produced by [The Manhattan Repertory Theatre](http://manhattanrep.com/) and [Casa de Beverley](http://casadebeverley.com/), and ran for four nights at a theater on 42nd Street in Manhattan. I had an amazing director, incredible actors, and felt so honored to see my work on stage. It’s also [captured on film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-odEpfpXCc), so you can check it out if you want._

**Set up a home server**

_I’ve been wanting this for a while. I ended up snagging a [Lenovo ThinkServer TS140](http://www.ebay.com/itm/301711364574) for sale on ebay, and a Synology DS214se 2-bay NAS. I first got Xen up and running on the server (mostly for practice running the hypervisor) and then installed Plex Media Server running in a VM. Then, I got the NAS up and running, moved over all my media, and got everything shared via NFS. I feel so much more comfortable with Linux and the command line now. Everything’s working wonderfully…at least for now._

**Soft launch my Idea to App Online Course**

_I haven’t done an all-out marketing initiative yet, but my [Idea to App Online Course](https://novicenolonger.usefedora.com/courses/idea-to-app-online-course) is currently available for purchase! More on this in 2016._

## Miscellaneous wins

*   My job at [MediaMath](http://mediamath.com)
*   Fantastic [girlfriend](http://www.asuleen.com/)
*   I saw a lot of _great_ theater this year
*   The [theater company](http://casadebeverley.com/) I co-founded is running strong in its second season

## Last year’s goals for this year

*   **Finish The Non-Programmer’s Guide to Getting an App in the App Store online course** – _Done._
*   **Create a powerful autoresponder series for new newsletter subscribers** – _Done._
*   **Do more public speaking** – _Didn’t get a chance to do as much as I wanted. Boo._
*   **Exercise regularly** – _I definitely exercised_ more_. Now I have to work on_ regularly_._
*   **Meditate** – _Missed this goal again._

*   Release at least five new tech-related videos and/or tutorials
*   Exercise on a regular schedule
*   Gain enough networking knowledge to start taking on network tickets at work
*   Gain enough systems knowledge to start taking on systems tickets at work

**Alright 2016. Let’s do this.**

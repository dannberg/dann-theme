![Daily Driver Task Management System](/images/blog/2020/05/daily-driver-task-management.jpg)

Sticking to a task-management system has been a long-time struggle for me. Before I discovered my current system (which I’ve nicknamed The Daily Driver), I’d find some new productivity/to-do app, migrate my life into it, use it for anywhere between a week to several months before eventually falling off the wagon.

The problems I had trying to keep up with these systems were usually either:

1. The systems were overly complicated (ie Omnifocus, 2Do) and were great at capturing _everything_ in my life but too much work to make myself use on a daily basis
2. I’d fall off the system (usually distracted by adhoc work), and the system would become either partially or completely obsolete. The work required to get back on track wouldn’t seem worth it

I found that for me, personally, I needed a productivity system with a regular, _built-in_ review of all outstanding items, otherwise the entire system became regularly obsolete. Likewise, it needed to be simple enough that I could leave and come back with minimal effort, yet robust enough to capture all my work in order to free my mind for deep thinking.

I’ve finally found that system.

TKTK Most detailed productivity system posts I’ve seen online are written by either engineers or entrepreneurs and try to maximize for long stretches of uninterrupted work time.

TKTK motivation and productivity naturally ebbs and flows. Need to set yourself up to take advantage of the motivated times, and make it easy for yourself to keep working when you feel less motivated.

# The Daily Driver System

Requirements:

1. A physical notebook (I use a [Large Squared Moleskin](https://amzn.to/3cfTb7A))
2. Digital Calendar (I use Google Calendar)
3. OPTIONAL A long-term storage system (I use [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/))

The overall Daily Driver system is a stripped-down version of three different productivity systems: David Allen’s _[Getting Things Done](https://amzn.to/2Wfxsak)_, [bullet journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/), and a basic daily to-do list. By picking and choosing the elements I found most useful from each of these systems, I’d developed a daily practice that’s been sustainable for me in the long term.

David Allen’s GTD system is well-known in the productivity community for good reason: it works. The goal of his system is to organize your work (and thus your brain) in order to achieve “mind like water” — a state in which your brain is free to focus on the task at hand because it isn’t worried about holding any other piece of information at the same time.

The GTD system is great, but overkill for my daily life. Instead, I’ve pulled out these useful elements:

*   If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately
*   Capture everything in a reliable system you can trust
*   Regularly review everything
*   Have a way to organize and store long-term tasks and projects

Productivity apps like 2Do, Things, and Omnifocus are designed for the entire GTD workflow. I find them much more useful for long-term storage of information, while I keep my daily task list much lighter and more nimble. I describe the long-term storage system in more detail a bit farther down this post.

The crux of this system is a physical notebook. You may find you prefer a digital notebook (like Bear, Agenda, or Evernote), and I’ll describe a modified version of the system for digital apps, but for me there’s no beating a physical notebook.

In my experience, everything the scientists say regarding physically writing notes is true. TKTK source. When notes are written in a physical notebook, I’m far more likely to 1) use the system, 2) review old notes (this is _key_), 3) remember what I’ve written.

This portion of the TKTK

## Setting up the notebook

The notebook setup borrows partially from the Bullet Journal setup. **You do not need a journal dedicated strictly to your Daily Driver task list.** In fact, I recommend against it (although you may want a new notebook when starting the system, if your current notebook doesn’t have the index described below). I also use my Daily Driver notebook to take notes during meetings, jot down notes, and flesh out ideas. It’s my daily driver, and I pretty much always have it handy.

The main thing keeping your notebook organized is the index. Turn to the first page of your notebook, and write the word “Index” across the first two pages. This will serve as the table of contents for your notebook. We’ll come back to this shortly.

Turn to the next page and write the month and year at the top of each page. On the left side, write the numbers one through [however many days are in the month]. Next to them, write a letter for the day of the month: M T W T F S S.

If any of these dates are dates-of-note, write that down next to the date. These can be holidays, birthdays, events, travel, etc. We’re not going to use this actively in our system, only to provide color and context during your review.

It should look something like this:

![Daily Driver Month Page](/images/blog/2020/05/daily-driver-month-view.jpg)

On the right page, under the month and year, you’re going to put monthly and long-term tasks, as seen above. For now, put down any to-do item that you’d like to accomplish at some point soon, _but not necessarily this month_. This list is designed for a monthly review (although you may choose to look over it more frequently if you want) so if a task is more urgent, save it for the next section.

At the bottom corners of these pages, number them `1` and `2`. Go back to your Index pages, and add the current year and the month name below it. Following the month name put a colon then a `1 -`. We’re leaving the end of the range empty, rather than putting two, because we don’t know yet how many pages this month will be. To the left of the month name, put a dash. This dash denotes a month, whereas you may add other topics to your index that aren’t months and will want to quickly pick out month names when using the index.

After a while, your Index page is going to look something like this:

![Daily Driver Journal Index Page](/images/blog/2020/05/daily-driver-index.jpg)

The last thing we’re going to do is set up the Daily Driver task list. Turn to the next blank page and write the month name at the top of each page (year is unnecessary here). Write the page numbers at the bottom corners.

We’re now ready to start our task list.

## The Daily Driver Task List

The Daily Driver task management system works _a page at a time_. This means you’ll never _need_ to look at more than one page as you’re managing your work. When you fill up a single page, you’ll carry over any unfinished tasks to the next page (in a process I describe below).

This is key, because re-writing your tasks forces you to review each one individually and re-evaluate its priority. Also, this review isn’t set to a specific day of the week or month, but instead based on the number of tasks you _have_ and _have completed_.

If this is your first time setting up a Daily Driver notebook, you won’t have any task items to carry over. Just write the date and day (I like the format 5/8/F for Friday, May 8th). Below this, you’ll add a bullet point for each task.

As you work throughout the day, put an `X` through a bullet point as a task is completed. Add additional tasks as they come up, keeping in mind that you should complete tasks that are less than two minutes immediately.

**Migrating to the next page**

When a page is full, it’s time to migrate everything to the next page. If you’ve been setting up a brand-new notebook, this means that page three is full, and you’ll be moving your working page to page four (the index doesn’t have page numbers, and the monthly overview are pages one and two).

Page four should already have the month name written at the top. If it doesn’t, write it now. Below that, instead of the date and day, put a small arrow pointing left, indicating that these are carried-over tasks.

Starting at the top of your previous task-list page, go through each item. Ask yourself:

1. Has this already been completed?
2. Is this still a priority?
3. Has this task changed in any way?
4. Can I complete this task quickly, so I don’t have to migrate it?
5. Does this task actually need to be completed this month?

Put an X through the bullet point of any task that has already been completed.

If the task is still a priority that needs to be completed this month, we’re going to migrate it to the next page. Create a bullet point on the new page and re-write the task, re-wording as needed to keep it relevant. Once you have re-written a task on the new page, you mark the old task as migrated by marking over the bullet point with a greater-than sign (>). This indicates that the task was not completed, but instead moved to the next page.

If a task is no longer something you need to do, cross it out entirely. If it’s lower priority, meaning it doesn’t need to be completed this month, add it to the monthly task list on the previous page and mark the bullet point with a less-than sign (&lt;).

If you’re like me, you’ll end up filling a page every four to seven days, or thereabouts. This is the perfect cadence for a full review/re-evaluation of your outstanding items. I’ve tried re-writing tasks every day, and it was too much unnecessary work. A weekly review would work in theory, but makes it much easier to slip out of the habit.

Migrating once a page is full means that you’re doing the work when it’s necessary, not simply because if a certain time of day or week. Additionally, reaching the end of a page only happens when you’re actively using your Daily Driver, so the effort it takes to do the migration is significantly less than trying to schedule it for, say, Monday mornings. You already have momentum to do the migration because you’re actively using the system and filling up a page.

**Digital Notebook Apps**

I moved the task management system to a digital app for about a year before going back to physical. While it worked, I personally found the cons to outweigh the pros. If you’re determined to use an app instead of a notebook, or you try both and find an app works better for you, here are some tips for what worked for me.

*   Have a dedicated “folder” for Daily Driver Tasks, and have different notes inside the folder work as “pages.”
*   Create a new “page” either every day or every week. I found weekly pages worked better for me.
*   **Do your migration work** first-thing Monday morning (for weekly) or each day (for daily). This is a habit you’ll need to build, as it’s harder to stick with the system when it’s just another application on your phone/computer

I personally used Agenda, but Bear, Evernote, or Apple Notes will work just as well. Find an app that you like that matches your priorities (design, compatibility, markdown support, exportability, etc) and stop looking. It’s easy to get distracted hunting for the perfect tool. It’s the system, not the tool, that will make you productive.

I personally found it a lot more challenging in the long term to stick with a digital app, which is why I went back to the physical notebook. The biggest challenge I found with digital is building a strong system around reviewing what you’ve written. I just didn’t do that as often (if at all) with digital notes. Whereas with a physical notebook, I found myself often browsing old notes or tasks in free moments, like before meetings or prepping for work.

If you’ve never used a physical notebook for task management and note taking, I recommend giving it a try. There’s a chance it’s not for you. But you may find you love it.

## Your Digital Calendar

![Daily Driver Task Management System](/images/blog/2020/05/fantastical-calendar.jpg)

Our Daily Driver Task List is the active part of our system — it’s what you’re writing in throughout the day, and reviewing when it’s time to work. It’s also may be where you take notes and do actual work.

Your digital calendar, however, is designed to be a passive part of our system. The goal of your calendar should be set-it-and-forget-it. That’s why a digital calendar, such as Google Calendar, is essential for this system.

Your digital calendar should hold _anything_ time sensitive, both work and personal. Anything that you’d like to be reminded of in the future should get an entry on your calendar.

This includes:

*   Meetings
*   Reminders about fees
*   Membership renewals
*   Movie/TV show release dates
*   Doctors appointments
*   Events
*   And many more

If there’s something you’d like to be reminded of in the future, _anything at all_, create a calendar event on the day you’d like the reminder.

In order to make this a passive system, all your events should have an alert. For meetings, a ten- to fifteen-minute warning works well. If you want to downgrade a credit card before paying the annual fee, an alert a week or two out may be better suited. For a movie/TV Show/video game release date, an alert the morning of is great.

Set the alerts to arrive when you’re able to process them (ie don’t set an alert for 7pm if you usually step away from your desk at 6pm). When you get an alert, act immediately:

*   If it requires an action that takes less than two minutes, do it immediately
*   If the action requires longer, add it to your Daily Driver task list
*   If it requires no action, thank yourself for the reminder and dismiss

You should design your calendar so that you look at it when you _want_ to, not because you need to. Typically, I’ll look at my calendar in the morning to get a feel for what my day will look like, making mental note of meeting times or other events. Then, throughout the day, I’ll rely on alerts to bring me to these time-sensitive events.

## Long-term storage
![Daily Driver Task Management System](/images/blog/2020/05/2do-folders.jpg)

In order to achieve David Allen’s “mind like water,” we need a place to store everything that doesn’t fit neatly into our system. Maybe you have an ambitious idea for a business that you’d like to start someday. Maybe you have several. It could be a book you want to write, or even plans to learn to paint.

All these amorphous ideas are taking up real estate in your brain, even if you don’t plan on taking any action on them at any point in the near future. You’re making effort to hold onto these thoughts, even if not consciously, and it’s impacting your ability to focus on the task at hand.

For things like these, I’ve found a robust productivity app to be a fantastic place to document all these ideas, flesh them out as much as possible, and just leave them alone for long-term storage.

A premium application such as 2Do (what I use) is probably overkill for this, but I’ve found that the structure of these more advanced apps better to both think within and review later.

**First-time Collection**

If this is your first time setting up a long-term storage system for your brain, set aside a good chunk of time Thirty minutes to an hour is probably sufficient, but you may need more depending on the number of different things your brain is holding.

We’re going to start in our inbox, as it is called in GTD. Take as much time as you need and make an entry for _everything_ that’s occupying space in your brain. Project ideas, people you want to call, doctor’s appointments that need to be made, things you want to pick up at the grocery store. Don’t worry about order at all, you’re just trying to brain dump in whatever order things come out.

Once you’ve exhausted the list of immediate items taking up space in your brain, it’s time to start organizing them into groups. Throughout this process, you’ll most likely think of new tasks/projects, as you’re not well on your way to mind-like-water. Add these to your inbox (unless they relate specifically to the current project you’re fleshing out) and process it later.

For organizing your long-term storage, I’ve found that some version of Area > Project > Task > Sub-task is the best way to break things down. Take a look at your inbox and see if there are any overarching themes tying tasks together. These should be broad, such as Money, or Writing, or Health.

As you identify these themes, create a list in the left-hand menu and drag all related inbox items inside. Once everything from your inbox is sorted into its respective theme, click on that theme.

These items will most likely be a mix of tasks (actual action items) or projects (larger goals that require multiple action items to execute). Flesh out and organize this theme as much as possible, breaking down all projects into specific next-steps, and organizing any tasks into larger projects as needed.

Once a theme section has been completely organized and you’ve exhausted all related tasks and ideas, move to the next theme.

As you’re fleshing out a theme, you’ll no doubt have several unrelated tasks or ideas come to you. Stop what you’re doing and jump back to the inbox to write it down to process later.

You’ll be done setting up your long-term storage when your inbox is empty, and all your themes are organized with projects, tasks, and possible sub-tasks.

## Tips and Tricks

*   Add a topic and a start page to your index _immediately_. Add an end page only when that topic is 100% complete (ie the end of a month) or if the following page is a different topic. If a single topic is split, with a different topic in the middle, put a comma after the first page range in the index, and add the second page range.
*   Tasks should be specific action items as much as possible, rather than broader topics. Rather than “TKTK” write “TKTK”.
*   If something is urgent, write an exclamation point to the left of the bullet point for a visual reminder.
*   Make sure calendar alerts actually get your attention. That means a push notification to your computer, phone, or watch, rather than an email that you might miss.

Here are the best things I’ve discovered, learned, read, wrote, made, and accomplished in 2013\. There’s no particular order and not everything on the list was conceived this year, even if they were a part of my life this year. Want to see how I stacked up to last year? Check out my [2012 year in review](http://novicenolonger.com/my-best-of-2012/ "My best of 2012")!

## My favorite blog posts by others

*   **[The Bad-Boy Brand: The Vice Guide to the World](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/04/08/130408fa_fact_widdicombe?currentPage=all)** by Lizzie Widdicombe
    _There are two companies successfully executing “new media”: Vice and Vox. This_ New Yorker _piece is a fantastic profile of the former._
*   **[Marcus London Ain’t Someone U Fuck With](https://www.nsfwcorp.com/dispatch/londons-calling-part-one/)** by Leigh Cowart[
    ](https://www.nsfwcorp.com/dispatch/londons-calling-part-one/)_An enthralling and extraordinarily well-written profile of porn star and entrepreneur Marcus London. London doesn’t quite share my positive feelings about the piece, however, threatening the publication with violence when it was published in their magazine. NSFWCORP, in turn, published the full piece online for free._
*   **[The Mega-Details Behind the New Design of The Smart Passive Income Blog](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/spi-theme-design/)** by Pat Flynn
    _I love reading detailed accounts of people building awesome products, and Pat Flynn is easily one of the best writers in this category._
*   **[Everything you need to know about PRISM](http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/17/4517480/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet)** by Verge Staff
    _More information has come to light since — and will_ continue _to be revealed in due time — but this is a fantastic look at this horrifying government program._
*   **[The Economics of Infomercials](http://priceonomics.com/the-economics-of-infomercials/)** by Jon Nathanson
    _A close look at the numbers behind those late-night shows that no one watches but everyone knows about. Spoiler: they’re surprisingly lucrative._

## Most viewed blog posts by me

*   [Body Hacking: My Magnetic Implant](http://www.iamdann.com/2012/03/21/my-magnet-implant-body-modification)
*   [Magnet Implants Can Actually be Pretty Annoying](http://www.iamdann.com/2013/02/15/magnet-implants-can-actually-be-pretty-annoying)
*   [How I made my iPhone app: from idea to app store](http://novicenolonger.com/how-i-made-my-ios-app-reader-tracker/)

## Total number of blog posts written

Nineteen – _this doesn’t count the pieces I wrote for The Verge and LAPTOP Magazine, which accounted for the majority of my writing in 2013_

## Number of books read

Twelve – _I usually like this number to be higher, but I substituted much of my reading time with online video courses this year_

## Favorite fiction books

*   **_[Wizard and Glass](https://amzn.to/2WyCxJv)_** by Stephen King
    _You may recognize this book from last year’s list — and that’s because I read it again this year. It was even better than I remembered it._
*   **_[A Supposedly Fun Things I’ll Never Do Again](https://amzn.to/3fx4evc)_** by David Foster Wallace
    _Although Wallace has a collection of stories by the same name, I just read the single essay. I read it while actually_ on _a cruise, which only enhanced the sheer enjoyment._
*   **_[The Long Walk](https://amzn.to/3b8RqHX)_** by Richard Bachman (Stephen King)
    _A group of kids must walk, with no breaks, until only one remains. Incredibly well written, with a surprise appearance from a character that King fans know all too well.
    _

## Favorite non-fiction books

*   **_[Authority](http://nathanbarry.com/authority/)_** by Nathan Barry
    _Authority reads as part instruction manual, part memoir. Nathan has had great success selling products online, and shares many valuable insights in Authority._
*   **_[Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion](https://amzn.to/2SZZHYz)_** by Dr. Robert Cialdini
    _I had seen this book recommended by a few of my favorite writers, but never picked it up until this year. I’m so glad I did._
*   **_[The Power of Habit](https://amzn.to/2zhrDQA)_** by Charles Duhigg
    _This book isn’t exactly what I was expecting (I feel kinda_ meh _about creative non-fiction in general) but it has some extremely valuable insights on human behavior._
*   **_[SPIN Selling](https://amzn.to/2WzXVxZ)_** by Neil Rackham
    _I haven’t read many books on the topic of selling, but I can’t imagine any other book being better than_ SPIN Selling.

## Gadgets of choice

*   **13-inch 2011 Macbook Air**
    _For a brief time, a 13-inch 2013 Haswell Air was my baby, but I had to give it up when I left [The Verge](http://theverge.com). Although I miss it dearly, my 2011 Air is still holding strong._
*   [**iPhone 5S**
    ](http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/)_Yes, I woke up at 3am to order the gold iPhone 5S. No, I haven’t regretted it a moment. Although the fingerprint scanner seems to be getting slightly worse over time…_
*   [**$69 Kindle with Special Offers**
    ](https://amzn.to/3b9MXV9)_I won’t be getting rid of this at any time in the foreseeable future. This non-touchscreen ebook is pretty much perfect, IMO._
*   **2012 iPad mini**
    _Sometimes I want to upgrade to the new mini — like when I feel the urge to play Knights of the Old Republic without performance issues — but last year’s model is still pretty fantastic otherwise._

## 2012 plans for 2013

*   **Finish writing my book** – _I’m no longer working on that project and have taken my writing in a new direction, so I don’t feel bad about not achieving this_
*   **Develop and teach two new Skillshare classes** – _brought one new class to life, and working on a massive online course (much more scalable). I’m happy with my progress here_
*   **Build and launch a functioning dynamic website with Ruby on Rails** – _My focus has shifted slightly away from coding, but in an exciting new direction (this website!)_
*   **Code and release updates for my two iOS apps** – _Fail — still in progress_
*   **Say ‘no’ more** – _I said ‘no’ to a job that was fantastic but wasn’t the right fit for me, so I’d consider this a success_
*   **Start consulting in the mobile app space** – _Spent some time consulting in person and on [Popexpert](https://www.popexpert.com/dannberg), so that’s all good_
*   **Meditate regularly** – _Man, I should really do this_
*   **Start doing yoga** – _Same with yoga, that did not happen in 2013_

## Plans for 2014

*   Finish [The Non-Programmer’s Guide to Getting an App in the App Store](http://novicenolonger.com/getting-an-app-in-the-app-store/) online course
*   Complete my book on building apps
*   Post at least one new article a week on Novice No Longer
*   Start experimenting with Adwords for my upcoming online course
*   Create a powerful autoresponder series for new newsletter subscribers
*   Meditate regularly

Bring it on, 2014.

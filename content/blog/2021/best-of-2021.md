![Dann's Desk 2021](/images/blog/2021/12/dann-desk-2021.jpg)

Here we go again.

Last year, when I sat down to do my regular end-of-year post, it felt so strange. We were still 2-3 months away from the first vaccines getting poked into arms, and the world still felt upside down. But I did a [2020 post](https://dannb.org/blog/2020/best-of-2020/) anyway. It actually made me feel a bit better about my year. Plus, I have such a long history of these posts (see [2012](http://novicenolonger.com/my-best-of-2012/), [2013](http://novicenolonger.com/my-best-of-2013/), [2015](http://novicenolonger.com/my-best-of-2015-a-year-in-review/), [2016](https://novicenolonger.com/best-of-2016/), [2018](https://novicenolonger.com/exhaustive-list-favorite-things-2018/)) that it seemed a shame to skip the routine.

This year, it feels much more natural. We're not completely back to normal, but 2021 didn't feel like a total wash in the same way 2020 felt.

I've played around with the formatting/content in the past, but this year I'm just sticking to the same thing I did last year: a few stats about my content followed by my favorite things from the year.

A couple of the links are Amazon affiliates. Why not, right?

Alright, enough chit chat. Let's dig in.

## Most viewed blog posts by me

I didn't publish much on this blog this year, but I pushed out a ton of writing through my [newsletter](https://dannb.org/newsletter/). Honestly, I'm fine with that. I'm super happy with how the newsletter is going, and sharing my best content there. In 2022, it's possible that I may expand an idea from the newsletter into a blog post. Best of both worlds.

- [Using a Debian ISO instead of a CD-ROM in your sources.list](https://novicenolonger.com/using-a-debian-iso-instead-of-a-cd-rom-in-your-sources-list/) - _Google still really likes pushing traffic to this old article_
- [Safe Python Playing with VirtualEnv](https://novicenolonger.com/safe-python-playing-with-virtualenv/) - _Another old article that still gets hits. Could probably use an update..._
- [Your Freelance Developer Won't Steal Your Idea](https://novicenolonger.com/freelance-developer-wont-steal-your-idea/) - _This advice still holds true_
- [Evolving your cloud-cost strategy as you scale](https://dannb.org/blog/2020/evolving-cloud-cost-strategy-scale/) - _An industry-related post I published last year that's doing okay_
- [Body Hacking: My Magnetic Implant](https://www.iamdann.com/2012/03/21/my-magnet-implant-body-modification) - _Wow, this post is almost ten years old now_

## Top videos by me

I was officially demonetized by YouTube this year. I guess that's what happens when you stop uploading content, despite having nearly 1,500 subscribers. Ah well. Thanks for all the passive income while it lasted, YouTube.

- [Installing a purchased Wordpress theme](https://youtu.be/nJ0uTu4Vxkk) - _Top video of mine, again. I'm so glad I made this tutorial series back in the day. It's certainly helped a lot of people_
- [Re-accessing the captive portal login screen](https://youtu.be/rOJU2JNtbCQ) - _I'm proud of this one, too. Super annoying problem and I'm glad I could share a solution_

## Favorite books read

Man, I really suck at reading when I don't have a daily commute. Before the pandemic, nearly all my reading was on the subway. Still, I managed to get a few books in this year. Here are my favorites.

- **_[Project Hail Mary](https://amzn.to/3EdN5BI)_** by Andy Weir - _I don't usually read much Science Fiction, but I really enjoyed_ The Martian _and figured I'd give this a go. I'm glad I did_
- **_[Die With Zero: Getting All You Can from Your Money and Your Life](https://amzn.to/3FhsHAO)_** by Bill Perkins - _A persuasive argument to use or give away all your money before you die, and how best to go about it_
- **_[How to DeFi: Beginner](https://amzn.to/3ecMUfg)_** by CoinGecko - _I had no idea all the crazy things that were happening in the world of decentralized finance. This was a great introduction_

## Favorite Movies

This was a big movie year for me. I watched 78 different films! You can find the full list on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/dannb/), but here are my favorites:

- **[Bo Burnham: Inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs-GdcUfl0Q)** (2021) - _An act of pure genius. The only "must watch" on this list, if you haven't seen it yet_
- **[The Handmaiden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whldChqCsYk)** (2016) - _Both writing and execution are excellent. This is what other movies wish they could be_
- **[The Power of the Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELvKuuXdfCU)** (2021) - _Great acting all around, and a joy to watch_
- **[The Act of Killing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GiqYLrJBG0)** (2012) - _Easily the best documentary I've ever seen. Deeply disturbing, insightful, entertaining, and jawdropping_
- **[High Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtOwfo1ypOw)** (2018) - _This movie was not at all what I was expecting. It definitely received mixed reviews when it was first released. But while the script was a bit sloppy, the story really stuck with me_

**Honorable mentions:** Benedetta (2021), The Humans (2021), Titane (2021), Promising Young Woman (2020).

## Favorite TV Shows
- **[I Think You Should Leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrZkGgoVSFk)** - _Not everyone's cup of tea. Certainly wasn't mine at first. But has grown on me like a fungus_
- **[How To with John Wilson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7aSybHRa6s)** - _Second season is currently airing. Oh my gosh, episode two..._
- **[The White Lotus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLq7_MonZ4)** - _Filmed at a luxury Hawaiian resort peak-pandemic, it's an interesting look at class dynamics. It's not perfect by any means, but it's certainly entertaining_
- **[Squid Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqxAJKy0ii4)** - _There was a lot of hype around Squid Game this year. It's deserved_

## Favorite Podcast

**[Your Kickstarter Sucks](https://shows.acast.com/yourkickstartersucks)** - _Really, the only podcast I listen to regularly. It's about terrible Kickstarter projects, but it's also not about that. It's the best._

## Notable Objects
- **Zojirushi Rice Cooker** - _I'm not usually a fan of single-use gadgets, but this one is worth the counterspace_
- **PlayStation 5** - _I was lucky enough to get my hands on one of these puppies. I've been digging Binding of Isaac, Fall Guys, and Final Fantasy VII_
- **[Sonos Beam (Gen 2)](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/beam)** - _I've always wanted a soundbar for my TV. Finally pulled the trigger this year. This little guy is great_
- **American Giant hoodie** - _If it's below 60 degrees, I'm wearing this hoodie_
- **[Thursday Captain Boots](https://thursdayboots.com/products/mens-captain-lace-up-boot-canyon?collection=boots)** - _Probably the best bang-for-your-buck boot. Also, my first pair of nice boots_
- **[Misto Oil Sprayer](https://amzn.to/3qaeCyR)** - _Just plain convenient_
- **[Nissin RAOH Tonkotsu Instant Ramen](https://amzn.to/3EeU4Kz)** - _A delicious upgrade to your standard instant ramen_

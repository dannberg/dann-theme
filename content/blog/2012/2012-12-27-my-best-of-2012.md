**This post originally appeared on [Novice No Longer](https://novicenolonger.com/my-best-of-2012/).**

Here are the best things I’ve discovered, learned, read, wrote, made, and accomplished in 2012. There’s no particular order and not everything on the list was conceived this year, even if they were a part of my life this year. Inspired by [Fogus](http://blog.fogus.me/2012/12/26/the-best-things-and-stuff-of-2012/).

Hello, I'm Dann. I work at the intersection of engineering, finance, and cloud cost optimization. In simpler terms, I help make big, scary cloud bills not so big or scary.

Want to do a deep dive? There's more on my **[About](/about)** page, or you can check me out on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannberg/)**, **[Github](https://github.com/dannberg)**, and **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/dannberg)**. If you want something more personal, you can find me at the monthly **[NYC FinOps Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/New-York-City-Cloud-FinOps/)**, which I help organize. It's also pretty easy to find more about me with a quick **[Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=dann+berg)**. Spelling Dann with two Ns is great for SEO.

In a past life, I was a tech journalist, and my writing has appeared on MSNBC, Fox News, The Verge, Mashable, Laptop Magazine, and Tomâ€™s Guide. I also co-authored a full-length play with my wife called **["The Floorshow"](http://combustioncollective.org/the-floorshow/)** about a group of tap-dancing showgirls in the 1950s.

I live in Brooklyn, New York with **[my wife](http://asuleen.com)** and our cat.

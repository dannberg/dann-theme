Hello, I'm Dann. I work at the intersection of engineering, finance, and cloud cost optimization. In simpler terms, I help make big, scary cloud bills not so big or scary.

Want to do a deep dive? Here's my **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannberg/)**, **[Github](https://github.com/dannberg)**, and **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/dannberg)** pages. It's also pretty easy to find more about me with a quick **[Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=dann+berg)**. Spelling Dann with two Ns is great for SEO.

In a past life, I was a tech journalist, and my writing has appeared on MSNBC, Fox News, The Verge, Mashable, Laptop Magazine, and Tomâ€™s Guide. I also co-authored a full-length play with my wife called **["The Floorshow"](http://combustioncollective.org/the-floorshow/)** about a group of tap-dancing showgirls in the 1950s.

I live in Brooklyn, New York with **[my wife](http://asuleen.com)** and two cats.

- Though now defunct, I used to actively update my website **[Novice No Longer](http://novicenolonger.com)**. It also had a **[podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/novice-no-longer-podcast-escape-novice-dom-build-life/id791188761?mt=2)** that people seemed to like.
- Here's some of my **[writing](https://www.theverge.com/users/DannBerg/posts)** from when I was Reviews Editor at The Verge.
- There was a time that I documented sticker art around New York City and published the website **[Stickers of NYC](http://www.stickersofnyc.com/)**.
- Even though they're no longer available, I have fond memories of my three apps: Reader Tracker (iOS), Watcher Tracker (iOS), and WorkBurst (macOS).

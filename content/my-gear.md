"Gear" content like this is my weakness. It can take many forms, from *What's in your Bag* articles to videos to Every Day Carry posts. Even holiday Gift Guides are basically the same genre of post. They're a guilty pleasure.

These types of post are a perfect storm of *consumerism* and *procrastination*. Each post or video is a chance to avoid doing actual work by yearning over shiny new toys. Maybe you'll find that one magic item that will boost your productivity or efficiency!

And honestly, I *have* found lots of great new gear that I've grown to love myself! That's why I keep consuming this content. It's like hunting for pearlsâ€”one of those oysters is going to have a big fat jewel inside.

So, here you have my own Gear page. For ease of reference, I've included links to the products where I could. Many of these links are affiliate links, which means if you click that link and purchase an item (even if it's not the item I linked to), then I'll get a small percent of that sale. Using these links is a great way to show your appreciation for this content, but in no way should you feel obligated to click.

**The Dann Chronicles** is a _free_ monthly roundup of interesting miscellanea that caught my attention over the past month. Things I think you'll find interesting as well.
{{% /class %}}

This newsletter isn't just a copy-paste from this blog. It's an entirely different thing not found anywhere else (except of course **[Substack](https://thedannchronicles.com/)**, which is what I use to send the emails).

It's way more than just a bare-bones link dump â€” each month you'll find short explorations into &#126;5 topics, with relevant links for you to follow when something catches your eye. Some times you may only give each topic a quick glance. Other months, there will be several rabbit holes you'll get sucked into exploring.

I know that sounds vague, so feel free to **[read a past edition](https://thedannchronicles.com/archive)** or two before you subscribe.

**Join >1,000 people and sign up to get next month's newsletter!**

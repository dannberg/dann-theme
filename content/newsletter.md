**The Dann Chronicles** is a _free_ monthly roundup of interesting miscellanea that caught my attention over the past month. Things I think you'll find interesting as well.

This newsletter content is completely different than anything you'll find on my blog or on YouTube. It's an entirely separate thing that contains some of my best writing (in my opinion). It's a great way to catch stories or happenings that you might otherwise have missed.

Each month you'll find short explorations into five topics, with relevant links for you to follow when something catches your eye. Some times you may only give each topic a quick glance. Other months, there will be several rabbit holes you'll get sucked into exploring.

I know that sounds vague, so feel free to **[read past editions](https://thedannchronicles.com/archive)** before you subscribe. The newsletter is—and always will be—free.

**Join >1,000 people and sign up to get next month's newsletter!**

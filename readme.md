# Repo for dannb.org

This is the personal website for Dann Berg, available at https://dannb.org. It is a static website created using Hugo. I created a custom theme I've lovingly dubbed Danntheme.

# Quick reference

## Running the server

`hugo server -D --disableFastRender`

`-D` tells it to render drafts and `--disableFastRender` tells Hugo to rebuild the entire website when there are changes (it's still super fast).

## Creating a new post

`hugo new blog/2021/post-name.md`
